printf like from scratch without any C library

This project has an aims of re-coding the Ainsi C printf from stdio.h

For this project , i have in first coding the [vasprintf](https://linux.die.net/man/3/vasprintf) fonction allowing the full recursion inside the fct.

For the recursion at each '%' sign the recursif vasprintf is call.

This feature allowing re-implementation of all *.printf stdio fct, and a small challenge for me.

the printf fct, that i used the more are :
- sprintf
- printf.

as far i concerned sprintf , i like saved the string buffer generated by vasprintf into a new fresh buffer in my projet, like Corewar for example

of course is not the perfect re-coding of printf, i have recoded only the compulsory '%' conversion in the project pdf files, and my small personal feature 

[PDF in French](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/20/ft_printf.pdf)

My time flow : 

- 1 weeks for the core feature
- 2 weeks for the tests fct and test checkers

An another challenge for me is the discovery of [va_list](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdarg/va_list/) and the parameter call for each recursion for the future cast in fonction of '%' sign

# utilisation

- add libftprintf.a in gcc makefile
- add "ft_printf.h" in header files

```
  #include "ft_printf.h"
  ```
